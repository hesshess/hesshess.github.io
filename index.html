        “Learn by building the app you want to create!”<br>
        Self-directed learning—it’s such an obvious and effective approach, almost like saying, “If you want to learn a foreign language, date a native speaker!”<br>
        But who doesn’t know that? The real problem is being unable to put it into action.</p>
        <p>From the moment I first started coding until recently, I never once imagined creating an app I genuinely wanted to build.<br>
        I was always too busy mimicking what others were making.<br>
        And maybe that’s why I’ve always been just an mediocre developer.</p>
        <p>Then one day, I suddenly had this thought:<br>
        Waiting to land a job as an old mediocre developer in a struggling economy isn’t very inspiring.<br>
        The person I imagine myself to be isn’t this dull.<br>
        So why have I let myself live this way for 35 years, settling into being just another ordinary person?</p>
        <p>I wasn’t born into a wealthy family, I didn’t graduate from a prestigious university, I don’t have a big savings account, and I don’t stand out in appearance.<br>
        But if there’s one thing I’ve always been proud of, it’s my sense of “cool.”<br>
        I didn’t want to do anything that felt uncool, and I refused to do it.<br>
        That’s what allowed me to be confident in myself, even without anything else to boast about.<br>
        (By “uncool,” I mean the broader definition of what I personally perceive as cool, not something related to appearances or visuals)</p>
        <p>Of course, this confidence only applied to me internally.<br>
        Externally, in society, I’m just a broke nobody, a braggart.<br>
        It’s sad, but it’s the reality, and I accept it.</p>
        <p>So what do I do now?<br>
        Am I going to sit here and sink even deeper?<br>
        Am I going to become a burden to my family?<br>
        (That’s the absolute worst-case scenario.)<br>
        No, I can’t let it end like this.<br>
        My family’s legacy isn’t wealth or fame; it’s survival.<br>
        Staying alive, enduring—that’s our inheritance.</p>
        <p>So I thought long and hard about what I can do.<br>
        And for the first time in five years, I suddenly found something I want to create.</p></div></div></div>
